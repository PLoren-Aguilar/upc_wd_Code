This is a Fortran 90 Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics code specialized in the simulation of white dwarfs binary mergers. It models the white dwarf stars using a degenerate equation of state (http://cococubed.asu.edu/code_pages/eos.shtml) and follows their evolution using the second order predicto-corrector method by Serna, Alimi and Chieze (1996). . Other features of the code are:<br>
- Calculates the gravitational wave emission generated by the stellar motion (see Loren-Aguilar et al. 2005 for details) <br>
- Calculates the nuclear reaction occurring in the stars as they evolve in time. NOTE: The nuclear network subroutine belongs to a third party and has been removed from the public repository. <br>
- Code is parallelized using a hybrid OpenMP / MPI scheme.
- The "individual time-steps" branch lets evolve particles with their own individual time steps to speed up the calculations<br>
 
Please, see Loren-Aguilar et al. 2009 for further details.
